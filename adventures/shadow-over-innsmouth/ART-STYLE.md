# Shadow over Innsmouth — Art Style Guide

## Overview

A richly colored, painterly cartoon style evoking 1920s New England coastal horror. Not desaturated — **fully saturated with intentional palette choices** that shift based on mood.

## Visual Influences

- **Gravity Falls** / **Hilda** — saturated cartoon with atmospheric depth
- **Over the Garden Wall** — autumnal palettes, environmental storytelling
- **Oxenfree** — indie adventure game mood, cinematic framing
- **Edward Gorey** — line quality, architectural detail, dread
- **Lovecraft pulp illustrations** — period accuracy, cosmic horror iconography
- **1930s Fleischer "Rubber Hose"** — bouncy geometry, expressive limbs, pie-cut pupils
- **Tibetan Thangka painting** — flat opaque fills, mineral pigment palette, decorative patterns on objects (NOT literal religious iconography or decorative borders)

## Color Palette

### By Scene Type

**Sunset/Exterior (Hope/Unease)**
- Sky: Deep teals, coral oranges, pink clouds
- Water: Rich blues, sunset reflections
- Architecture: Warm cream/tan clapboard, weathered wood browns
- Accents: Red-orange buoys, teal trim, lighthouse white

**Night/Horror (Dread/Revelation)**  
- Sky: Deep blue-gray, silver moonlight
- Water: Dark teal, black depths, white seafoam
- Lighting: Warm gold candlelight, amber magical energy
- Deep Ones: Blue-gray robes, green scales, yellow glowing eyes

**Interior (Oppression/Decay)**
- Walls: Sickly yellows, peeling greens, water-stained browns
- Wood: Dark mahogany, warped floorboards
- Lighting: Single warm sources (lamps, windows), deep shadows
- Details: Fish motifs everywhere — wallpaper, carvings, patterns

## Line Work

- **Clean cartoon lines** — consistent medium weight
- **Slightly sketchy quality** — not sterile, has hand-drawn feel
- **Visible ink quality** — evokes traditional illustration
- **Architectural detail** — buildings are characters, show their age

## Rendering Style

- **Painterly/gouache feel** — visible brushwork texture in fills
- **Not cell-shaded** — soft edges where appropriate
- **Atmospheric depth** — fog, haze, layered backgrounds
- **Rich shadows** — pools of darkness, contrast with light sources

## Composition

- **Cinematic aspect ratios** — wide shots (2.35:1 to 16:9)
- **Environmental storytelling** — details tell the story (scratched warnings, fish motifs, decay)
- **Layered depth** — clear foreground, mid-ground, background with atmospheric separation
- **Character framing** — figures provide scale, often dwarfed by environment

## Period Accuracy (1920s-1930s)

- **Architecture**: New England coastal — clapboard, Victorian decay, saltbox houses
- **Vehicles**: Period buses, fishing boats
- **Clothing**: Trench coats, wool caps, leather satchels, period-appropriate punk (for Kat)
- **Technology**: Gas lamps, minimal electricity, everything feels old
- **Typography**: Gothic/art deco for titles

## Character Design

### Hermes
- Nerdy, endearing — round glasses, messy brown hair
- Brown tweed jacket, green sweater, tan trousers
- Leather satchel (always)
- Expressive — worry, curiosity, fear clearly readable

### Kat  
- Modern punk anachronism — leather jacket, band tees, combat boots
- Dark hair, pale skin, dark circles under eyes
- Headphones (before transformation)
- Guarded posture — arms crossed, hunched
- Transformation: Scales emerge, eyes turn gold, fingers web

### Deep Ones / Innsmouth Look
- Progression of transformation: slightly off → clearly inhuman
- Wide-set eyes, narrow faces, glistening skin
- Gill ridges on neck, webbed fingers (subtle to obvious)
- Robed congregation in browns/grays
- Full Deep Ones: Fish-like heads, glowing yellow eyes, blue-gray skin

## What to Avoid

- ❌ Desaturated/washed out palettes (use full color)
- ❌ Generic AI "digital art" look
- ❌ Harsh cell-shading
- ❌ Modern elements (except Kat's deliberate anachronism)
- ❌ Gore/explicit horror (atmosphere over shock)
- ❌ Sterile clean lines (keep the hand-drawn feel)
- ❌ Decorative borders/frames on backgrounds (scenes must be edge-to-edge)
- ❌ Literal religious iconography from influences (Thangka influence = aesthetic only, not Buddhist imagery)

*This style serves the story: cosmic horror with heart. The colors are rich because the tragedy is real — we care about these characters before the darkness takes them.*
