# Art Direction

## Core Aesthetic

**Coloristic, not dim.** Even when depicting decay, decadence, or horror - the palette stays vibrant. Mood comes from composition, lighting direction, and texture - not desaturation.

Reference: The Innsmouth dock scene uses rich sunset oranges, deep ocean blues, weathered wood browns. It's atmospheric but alive.

## Style

- **Backgrounds**: Painterly, textured, layered for parallax
- **Characters**: Clean animation-style lines, expressive poses
- **Palette**: Saturated even in moody scenes - decay is in texture, not color drain

## Character Designs

### Hermes
- **Age**: 22 (Game 1), ages across series
- **Look**: Brown tweed jacket, green v-neck sweater, round glasses, messy brown hair
- **Props**: Leather satchel, journal (always)
- **Personality**: Nerdy, endearing, curious. Loves ancient history & puzzles.

**Character Arc Across Series:**
| Game | Visual Evolution |
|------|------------------|
| 1-2 | Green sweater, nervous energy, clutches satchel, wide-eyed |
| 3-4 | Darker jacket, steadier posture, worn satchel, more confident |
| 5-7 | Brown leather jacket, no glasses, practical gear, weathered journal. Indiana Jones energy. |

### Kat (Shadow over Innsmouth)
- **Look**: Black messy hair, leather jacket, band t-shirt, ripped jeans, combat boots
- **Props**: Military backpack with punk patches, headphones
- **Personality**: Guarded, moody, hiding something. The headphones are a wall.
- **Arc**: Cold stranger → vulnerable → transformed → lost

## Scene Guidelines

1. **Sunset/dusk**: Use warm oranges against cool blues. Don't flatten to grey.
2. **Interiors**: Warm incandescent tones, visible light sources, deep shadows but not muddy.
3. **Horror moments**: Color CONTRAST increases, not decreases. Sickly greens, wrong reds.
4. **The Look moments**: Pull back saturation slightly ONLY here - makes it feel different.

## What to Avoid

- Desaturated "gritty" palettes
- Generic digital gradient shading
- Dim = scary (lazy)
- Brown/grey color mud
- Overly clean vector art (needs texture)
